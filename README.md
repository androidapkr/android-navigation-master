# previous fragment arguments lost at navigationUp in Navigation Architechture Components 

I'm creating there fragments 

Step1 : From Fragment1 --> Fragment2 and passing argument

Step2 : Now Fragment2 button1 for navigating Fragment2 --> Fragment3 

Step3 : While calling navigateUp in Fragment3 --> Fragment2 and pass back argument, its navigate to Fragment2 but its lost arguments which is passing from Fragment1 (which is passing from step 1)
